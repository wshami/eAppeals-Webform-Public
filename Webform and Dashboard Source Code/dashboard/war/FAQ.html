				<td id="information-description"
					style="border-bottom: 1px solid; vertical-align: top;">The appeal process is an opportunity for appellants to request the correction of errors made during the review of your application materials.    Applicants may not seek to amend or add new material to their initially submitted application through the appeal process. Appeals can be submitted regarding personnel processes, including the review of suspensions of 1-5 day(s), probationary reduction, probationary discharge, classification studies, and miscellaneous personnel actions to determine if the decision was justified.

The appeal response is <b><u>only</u></b> provided by email or mail (if U.S. Mail was selected as the response option) to the appellant and/or his/her authorized representative.</td>
